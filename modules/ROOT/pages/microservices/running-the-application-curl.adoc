// {application-ip-address} -> The IP address of the running application

Now, you can make calls to application endpoints to put data and get it back. Firstly, run the following command to put the data into Hazelcast distributed map:

----
curl --data "key=key1&value=hazelcast" "{application-ip-address}:8080/put"
----

You will see the value in the output. Then run the command below to get the data back. Please note that the call is made to the other application instance:

----
curl "{application-ip-address}:8081/get?key=key1"
----

Again, you will see the value in the output since the data is distributed among Hazelcast cluster instances and can be accessed from any of them.
