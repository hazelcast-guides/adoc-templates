== Getting started

The fastest way to work through this guide is to clone the Git repository and use the project provided inside:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ > git clone {github-address}
$ > cd {project-folder}
----

The `initial` directory contains the starting project that you will build upon.

The `final` directory contains the finished project that you will build.
