== Great work! Youâ€™re done!

You have just run a {framework} application then connected it to your Hazelcast Cloud account. 
Then you stored data using your app and Hazelcast Cloud. When you shut down the app, containerized it and run again on Docker, 
you saw the data is not lost. Then you deployed the app to Kubernetes and saw that data is shared between microservices.
As a last step, you ran integration tests against hazelcast-{framework-short} that was deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
