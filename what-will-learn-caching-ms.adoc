== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use Hazelcast distributed caching with {framework} and deploy to a local {kube} cluster.
You will then create a Kubernetes Service which load balance between containers and verify that you can share data between Microservices.

The microservice you will deploy is called `hazelcast-{framework-short}`. The `hazelcast-{framework-short}` microservice simply
helps you put a data and read it back. As Kubernetes Service will send the request to different pod each time 
you initiate the request, the data will be served by shared hazelcast cluster between `hazelcast-{framework-short}` pods.

You will use a local single-node {kube} cluster. However, you can deploy this application on any kubernetes distributions.
