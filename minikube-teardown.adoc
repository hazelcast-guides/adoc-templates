== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can delete all Kubernetes resources by running the kubectl delete command: You might need to wait up to 30 seconds as stateful sets kills pods one at a time.

----
$ > kubectl delete -f kubernetes.yaml

[system]#*Windows* | *Mac*#

Nothing more needs to be done for Docker Desktop.

[system]#*Linux*#

Perform the following steps to return your environment to a clean state.

. Point the Docker daemon back to your local machine:
+
```
$ > eval $(minikube docker-env -u)
```

. Stop your Minikube cluster:
+
```
$ > minikube stop
```

. Delete your cluster:
+
```
$ > minikube delete
```
