Start your Docker Desktop environment. Make sure "Docker Desktop is running" and "Kubernetes is running" status are updated. 

ifdef::docker-desktop-description[]
{docker-desktop-description}
endif::[]

[system]#*Linux*#

Run the following command from a command line:

[subs="attributes"]

endif::[]
ifndef::minikube-start[]
